      "description": "(Palo Alto) On May 6 and May 11, 2015, Unit 42 observed two targeted attacks, the first against the U.S. government and the second on a European media company. Threat actors delivered the same document via spear-phishing emails to both organizations. The actors weaponized the delivery document to install a variant of the ‘'9002 RAT'’ Trojan called ‘3102’ that heavily relies on plugins to provide functionality needed by the actors to carry out on their objectives.\n\nThe 3102 payload used in this attack also appears to be related to the 'EvilGrab RAT' payload delivered in the watering hole attack hosted on the President of Myanmar’s website in May 2015.  Additionally, we uncovered ties between the C2 infrastructure and individuals in China active in online hacking forums that claim to work in Trojan development.",

Named AbaddonPOS by Proofpoint researchers, this sample was initially discovered as it was being downloaded in the process of a 'Vawtrak' infection. This use of additional payloads to enhance attack capabilities offers another example of efforts by threat actors to expand their target surfaces through the delivery of multiple payloads in a single campaign, in this case by including potential PoS terminals. This post will analyze AbaddonPOS; discuss the observed infection vectors; and expose, details on the downloader used to retrieve this new PoS malware. We will also provide evidence to demonstrate that the downloader malware and PoS malware are closely related, perhaps even written by the same actor or actors.",

The defense against the attack was named ‘Operation Buckshot Yankee’. It led to the creation of the United States Cyber Command.\n\nIt started when a USB flash drive infected by a foreign intelligence agency was left in the parking lot of a Department of Defense facility at a base in the Middle East. It contained malicious code and was put into a USB port from a laptop computer that was attached to United States Central Command.",

This channel works independently of the operating system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall and network monitoring applications running on the host device. Until this incident, no malware had been discovered misusing the AMT SOL feature for communication.\n\nUpon discovery of this unique file-transfer tool, Microsoft shared information with Intel, and the two companies collaborated to analyze and better understand the purpose and implementation of the tool. We confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications.",

It seems that such values only exist from Windows 10, so we assume that the author developed and tested it on Windows 10.\n\nAt the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the “CheckUpdate” parameter. This file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor. But the devil is in the detail, as usual.\n\nThe code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path included in the updater and used as unique HTTP multipart message data separator string. Because of this, and the fact that the attacked platforms include Apple macOS, we decided to call this Operation AppleJeus.",

Many comment leavers recommend it.\n\nAZORult is a Trojan stealer that collects various data on infected computers and sends it to the C&C server, including browser history, login credentials, cookies, files from folders as specified by the C&C server (for example, all TXT files from the Desktop folder), cryptowallet files, etc.; the malware can also be used as a loader to download other malware. Kaspersky Lab products detect the stealer as Trojan-PSW.Win32.Azorult. Our statistics show that since the start of 2019, users in Russia and India are the most targeted.",

Discovered by the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT), this PoS malware targeted the US. Interestingly, we saw a clear decrease of hits during “dead hours” specifically at 2:00 AM, and an apparent recurring rise of hits at 10:00 AM. This trend follows regular business operation hours wherein PoS devices are more likely to be active and in use. Generally, the hits increase during business hours and decline during off-hours.",

As the name suggests, it’s main characteristic is small size (very often in the 10-50kB range).\n\nBackswap carries out multiple harmful activities. Big ones are: injecting Webinjects and stealing credentials. Supported browsers involve Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome. Some variants also swap the contents of the clipboard when bank/cryptocurrency account number is found.",

Researchers from Gigamon analyzed the sample and found similarities with 'PunchBuggy', but Badhatch features new capabilities that allow it to scan for victim networks, provide attackers with remote access, install a backdoor, and deliver other modified malware payloads such as 'PoSlurp' and PunchBuggy, among other features.\n\nBadhatch begins infection much like its predecessor PowerSniff, by sending a customized phishing email via a weaponized Word document. Once the victim enables the macros, it executes PowerShells and shellcode scripts for PowerSniff, installing a backdoor in the process. Its network scan capability makes it different from PowerSniff; it is unable to check if the systems infected is in the education or healthcare sector. The researchers also noted that it lacks the sandbox detection and anti-virus analysis evasion features, as well as the long-term persistence tools that its predecessor had. However, they note that this also serves as an advantage as the attackers can execute the routine after infection and have greater control on how the malware can be used, thereby avoiding automated sandboxing features.",

PFD made the discovery while analyzing a command and control (C2) server that was previously observed hosting the ImageID skimmer variant. PFD’s investigation revealed seven C2 servers hosting the Baka skimming kit. While the skimmer itself is basicand contains the expected features offered by many ecommerce skimming kits (e.g. data exfiltration using image requests and configurable target form fields), the Bakaskimming kit’s advanced design indicates it was created by a skilled developer.",

In addition, the malware also implements a custom VNC like protocol which sends screenshots of the desktop to the C2 server and accepts keyboard and mouse input. The malware communicates to its C2 servers using SSL, with self signed SSL certificates. The malware family will create a copy of cmd.exe to perform its C2 activity, and replace the 'Microsoft corp' strings in the cmd.exe binary with different values. The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.",

The 'bazar' domain can only be utilized on Emercoin's DNS servers, and as it is decentralized, it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for law enforcement to seize the hostname.\n\nAfter the payload is downloaded, it will be filelessly injected into the C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe process. Security researcher Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer that this is done using the Process Hollowing and Process Doppelgänging techniques.\n\nAfter a period of time, both Kremez and James have told BleepingComputer that the backdoor will download and execute the 'Cobalt Strike' penetration testing and post-exploitation toolkit on the victim's machine.",

While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least 2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file’s contents.\n\nAttacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and FireEye revealed attacks using Bisonal against Japanese organizations. In October 2017, AhnLab published a report called “Operation Bitter Biscuit,” an attack campaign against South Korea, Japan, India and Russia using Bisonal and its successors, Bioazih and Dexbia. We believe it is likely these tools are being used by one group of attackers.",

      "description": "BlackEnergy, its first version shortened as BE1, started as a crimeware being sold in the Russian cyber underground as early as 2007. Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\n\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\n- download and execute a remote file;\n- execute a local file on the infected computer;\n- update the bot and its plugins;\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\n\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\n- operations with victim's filesystem\n- spreading with a parasitic infector\n- spying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\n- Team viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\n- listing Windows accounts and scanning network\n- destroying the system\n\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government. The power grid compromise has become known as the first-of-its-kind cyber warfare attack affecting civilians.",

      "description": "(ThreatFabric) Around May 2020 ThreatFabric analysts have uncovered a new strain of banking malware dubbed BlackRock that looked pretty familiar. After investigation, it became clear that this newcomer is derived from the code of the Xerxes banking malware, which itself is a strain of the 'LokiBot' Android banking Trojan. The source code of the Xerxes malware was made public by its author around May 2019, which means that it is accessible to any threat actor.\n\nTechnical aspects aside, one of the interesting differentiators of BlackRock is its target list; it contains an important number of social, networking, communication and dating applications. So far, many of those applications haven't been observed in target lists for other existing banking Trojans. It therefore seems that the actors behind BlackRock are trying to abuse the grow in online socializing that increased rapidly in the last months due to the pandemic situation.\n\nBlackRock offers a quite common set of capabilities compared to average Android banking Trojans. It can perform the infamous overlay attacks, send, spam and steal SMS messages, lock the victim in the launcher activity (HOME screen of the device), steal and hide notifications, deflect usage of Antivirus software on the device and act as a keylogger. Interestingly, the Xerxes Trojan itself offers more features, but it seems that actors have removed some of them in order to only keep those that they consider useful to steal personal information.",

The front-end is built on electron and the back-end is a Neo4j database, the data leveraged is pulled from a series of data collectors also referred to as ingestors which come in PowerShell and C# flavours.\n\nIt can be used on engagements to identify different attack paths in Active Directory (AD), this encompasses access control lists (ACLs), users, groups, trust relationships and unique AD objects. The tool can be leveraged by both blue and red teams to find different paths to targets. The subsections below explain the different and how to properly utilize the different ingestors.",

Manuscrypt is one of the Lazarus group’s tools that is actively being updated and used. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising this victim, Lazarus attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool, but failed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying various freeware and red-teaming tools used.\nAlthough Lazarus has recently tended to focus more on targeting the financial industry, we believe that in this campaign they were seeking to exfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread Bookcode using a decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector. Based on our observations, we evaluate that the Bookcode malware is being used exclusively for cyber-espionage campaigns.",

It implements the expected behavior of ransomware, discovering local drives and network shares and encrypting files found on these devices. It doesn’t require an internet connection to encrypt its victims’ files, since it doesn’t communicate with a server to send the encryption keys. Instead, it appends a “token” at the end of the ransom message and demands that the victims communicate with the operators via email or Bitmessage.\n\nTo encrypt as many important resources as possible, Filecoder.Buran starts a thread dedicated to killing key software that might have open handles on files containing valuable data, thus preventing them being encrypted. The targeted processes are mainly database management systems (DBMS). Furthermore, Filecoder.Buran removes log files and backups, to make it as difficult as possible for victims without any offline backups to recover their files.",

Both of the malware variants encoded and compressed the underlying network traffic to bypass any network-based security controls that were implemented.\n\nThe malware variants in question do not appear to belong to any known malware family, although the structure of the network communication does bear a resemblance to the 'Derusbi' malware family, which has shown to be unique to Chinese cyber espionage operators. Past observations of Derusbi in various attack campaigns indicate the version used was compiled specifically for that campaign. Derusbi has had both the client and server variants deployed, using different combinations of configurations and modules. The newly discovered activity is consistent with this procedure, with compile times only a few days prior to the observed attacks.",

The Trojan functions primarily as a downloader that relies on emails to communicate between the Trojan and the C2 server. To communicate with the C2 server, the Trojan will send emails to specific email addresses via SMTPS over TCP port 587. The specific functions of Cannon can be seen in Table 1.

The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted.\n\nTo ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is “<ServiceName>Sys” where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the first character deleted. For example, if the existing service ́s name is “aspnet” and the visible name is “Asp.net state service”, the service created by the malware would be “aspnetSys” with a visible name of “Sp.net state service”.\n\nBefore creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation.

While not as sophisticated as HenBox, certain samples of CarbonSteal do make use of a combination of native libraries and DEX classes, while others do not and are much simpler.\n\nHallmarks of CarbonSteal include extensive audio recording functionality in a variety of codecs and audio formats, as well as the capability in later samples to control an infected device through specially crafted SMS messages. Attackers can also perform audio surveillance through the malware’s ability to silently answer a call from a specific phone number and allow the attacker to listen in to sounds around an infected device. Based on this functionality, we suspect that CarbonSteal might be deployed in areas with insufficient or no mobile data coverage.\n\nSamples of CarbonSteal and 'HenBox' also use the same non-compromised signing certificates in many cases, suggesting the actor behind their deployment is the same. Furthermore, overlapping validity dates of these certificates may indicate that the samples were produced around the same time frame. This evidence led Lookout researchers to the theory that these tools were primarily used in an ongoing malware campaign (at the time) and against similar targets, with titles and languages once again suggesting a Uyghur focused interest.",

Once dropped onto your Android device, the malicious app looks like the icon seen in the screen below and is titled “System Application.”\n\nWorse still, this piece of malware can also go after your bank account login details. This malware has the ability to pose as over 2,200 banks and financial institutions. It does so by adopting the logo and mobile application name of a bank used in the Google Play Store, allowing the author to use simple templates to harvest username and password or credit card information. The overlay is HTML-based and not as sophisticated as other Android banking malware such as 'LokiBot', 'Red Alert', or 'ExoBot', but the power here is clearly in the shotgun approach: using simple phishing overlay screens, the criminals are able to target many more users, increasing their likelihood of financial gain.",

In contrast to PlugX and PIVY, which are used by multiple campaigns, ChChes appears to be unique to this group. An analysis of the malware family can be found later in this blog.\n\nInterestingly, the ChChes samples we observed were digitally signed using a certificate originally used by HackingTeam and later part of the data leaked when they were themselves hacked. Wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting Japan in November. It’s not clear why the attackers chose to use this certificate, as it was old, had been leaked online, and had already been revoked by the time they used it. Digital certificates are typically used because they afford an air of legitimacy, which this one definitely does not.",

The web shell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised Windows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390, but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels.\n\nIn our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web servers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have additional data about how the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as older versions of Oracle WebLogic or WordPress that may have been targeted with known remote code execution or file inclusion exploits.\n\nChina Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to connect to and generate server-side code that must be added to the targeted website code in order to communicate.\n\nThe server-side code is extremely simple and contains, depending on the application platform, just a single line of code. The backdoor supports .NET Active Server Pages or PHP.\n\nWe cannot be sure if the simplicity of the server code was a deliberate decision on the part of the China Chopper developers to make detection more difficult, but using pattern matching on such as short snippet may produce some false positive detections.\n\nThe China Chopper client communicates with affected servers using HTTP POST requests. The only function of the server-side code is to evaluate the request parameter specified during the configuration of the server code in the client GUI. In our example, the expected parameter name is 'test.' The communication over HTTP can be easily spotted in the network packet captures.\n\nChina Chopper contains a remote shell (Virtual Terminal) function that has a first suggested command of 'netstat an|find 'ESTABLISHED.'' and it is very likely that this command will be seen in process creation logs on affected systems.",

Banks in the UK, Spain, the US, Russia, Japan and Italy make up the majority of its potential targets.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect the new banking malware as Trojan-Banker.Win32.Chthonic.\n\nThe Trojan is apparently an evolution of 'ZeusVM', although it has undergone a number of significant changes. Chthonic uses the same encryptor as 'Andromeda' bots, the same encryption scheme as Zeus AES and Zeus V2 Trojans, and a virtual machine similar to that used in ZeusVM and 'KINS' malware.",

The malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks the first time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other than possible small-scale testing.\n\nThe CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as “BastionSolution” and “OneDriveSolution”) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is significantly different. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded C&C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service for communicating with its masters, making it significantly harder for defenders to notice the traffic and block the communication channel. What is most significant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the first days of July and the other starting from the 20th of the month. Details of the first wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke, was published by Palo Alto Networks on 14th July. This was followed by additional details from Kaspersky in a blog post published on 16th July.",

Instead of finding API function names based on their hashed values, this malware enumerates libraries’ export address table (EAT) and searches for the name of the API function the payload needs to load by using a character to offset array. The payload pairs several comma-separated lists of characters with comma-separated lists of numbers.

Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\n\nThe Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.",

Comnie, first named by Sophos seemingly after the Windows LNK file name it created, is a custom malware family that is used in targeted attacks, and has been observed in the wild since at least April 2013. The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages online blogs and third-party services to obtain command and control (C2) information. Recent instances of the malware have been observed leveraging github.com, tumbler.com, and blogspot.com.\nAttackers using Comnie are leveraging malicious macros that initially hide decoy documents and shows them when the victim enables macros. These decoys documents pertain to various subject matters that the targets would be likely to be interested in.",

The features are rather common for today’s espionage tools: file management (download and upload), screenshot taking, Keylogger functionality, code execution possibility and more. It uses the HTTPS and an asymmetric encryption (RSA) to communicate with the command and control server. The big novelty is the persistence mechanism: the malware hijacks a legitimate COM object in order to be injected into the processes of the compromised system. And it is remarkable, that this hijacking action does not need administrator rights. With this RAT, Attackers could spy on an infected system for quite a long time, as this detection evasion and persistence mechanism is indeed pretty advanced!",

This control introduces the novel ability of skipping the encryption of local files and only targeting networked SMB shares, including those from IP addresses specifically provided by the adversary. This is a very rare ability that’s previously been seen with the Sodinokibi ransomware family.\n\nAnother new technique, documented in very few ransomware families, is the use of the Windows Restart Manager to ensure that all files can be encrypted. Just as Windows will attempt to cleanly shut down open applications when the operating system is rebooted, the ransomware will utilize the same functionality to cleanly close the application that has a file locked. By doing so, the file is freed up for encryption.",

While similar threats have existed for years, this tactic did not become widespread until CryptoLocker's considerable success. Traditionally, ransomware disabled victims' access to their computers through non-destructive means until the victims paid for the computers' release.\n\nEarly CryptoWall variants closely mimicked both the behavior and appearance of the genuine CryptoLocker. The exact infection vector of these early infections is not known as of this publication, but anecdotal reports from victims suggest the malware arrived as an email attachment or drive-by download. Evidence collected by CTU researchers in the first several days of the February 2014 campaign showed at least several thousand global infections.",

The program was discontinued, partially due to its use in the Syrian civil war to monitor activists but also due to its author's fear of being arrested for unnamed reasons. As of August 2018, the program's development 'has ceased indefinitely', and downloads are no longer offered on its official website.\n\nDarkComet allows a user to control the system with a graphical user interface. It has many features which allows a user to use it as administrative remote help tool; however, DarkComet has many features which can be used maliciously. DarkComet is commonly used to spy on the victims by taking screen captures, key-logging, or password stealing.",

We have named this tool that generates these documents DealersChoice.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of this new tactic, we were able to identify two different variants of the embedded SWF files: the first being a standalone version containing a compressed payload which we have dubbed DealersChoice.A and a second variant being a much more modular version deploying additional anti-analysis techniques which we have dubbed DealersChoice.B. The unearthing of DealersChoice.B suggests a possible code evolution of the initial DealersChoice.A variant. Also, artifacts within DealersChoice suggests that Sofacy created it with the intentions to target both Windows and OSX operating systems, as DealersChoice could potentially be cross-platform due to its use of Adobe Flash files.",

Some of the possible data that can be stolen from POS systems include such as username, hostname, key to decrypt the sent information, OS information, and list of running processes. These data are then presumably duplicated by remote malicious users.\n\nThe malware executable is found to be packed or encrypted and when loaded, it loads long garbage code to decrypt the actual code. However, this decryption routine involves only a combination of XOR and ADD instructions, with the use of a hardcoded key.

The difference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain text requests to port 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. Oilrig added the publicly available DNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows DoH queries to Google and Cloudflare services. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVID-related domain which are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples.",

This app was the first publicly exposed sample of a malware family called DoubleAgent. When Lookout initially investigated DoubleAgent in 2015, it was already an advanced Android remote access tool (RAT). Early versions of this family trojanized apps such as Voxer and TalkBox, as well as Amaq News, the official Daesh news application. The extent of this malware family and its connections to other campaigns has not been publicly reported on until now. Lookout researchers have seen DoubleAgent used exclusively against groups with contentious relationships with the Chinese government.\n\nAlthough Lookout has been tracking this malware family for many years, new samples discovered in the last year indicated that the actors behind DoubleAgent were continuing to evolve the surveillanceware and use new infrastructure. However, they maintained the same targeting, as well as several key malware characteristics, such as similar decryption keys for configuration files.\n\nThese recent samples, discovered in late 2019, are the focus of this section on DoubleAgent. A decryption of the configuration files from these samples revealed a direct overlap in C2 infrastructure between the operators of DoubleAgent and 'SilkBean' at a time when both malware families appeared to be active.",

These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.'\nAccording to MalwareBytes, 'Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.'\nIBM X-Force discovered 'a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the 'atom tables' that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.'",

      "description": "(SecureWorks) In early June 2014, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team discovered the Dyre banking trojan, which was being distributed by 'Cutwail' botnet spam emails that included links to either Dropbox or Cubby file storage services. The threat actors later shifted to distribution via the 'Upatre' downloader trojan. Dyre is also known as Dyreza, Dyzap, and Dyranges by the antivirus industry.\n\nDyre harvests credentials, primarily targeting online banking websites to perform Automated Clearing House (ACH) and wire fraud. The malware includes a modular architecture, man-in-the-browser functionality, and a backconnect server that allows threat actors to connect to a bank website through the victim's computer. The man-in-the-browser functionality is based on a unique combination of redirects to fake websites controlled by the threat actor ('web fakes') and a dynamic web inject system that allows the threat actors to manipulate a financial institution's website content. Similar to other banking trojans, Dyre hooks into the most popular web browsers to intercept traffic from a victim's system, stealing information and manipulating website content before it is rendered by the browser.\n\nEarly Dyre versions were relatively primitive, sending command and control (C2) communications and stolen data via unencrypted HTTP. Recent iterations of Dyre use SSL to encrypt all C2 communications, as well as a custom encryption algorithm. Dyre also uses RSA cryptography to digitally sign configuration files and malware plugins to prevent tampering.",

The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be tunneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a tunneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password. This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system’s required authentication to reach outside of the network.",

The custom algorithm used by Emissary and Elise to decrypt their configurations use the “srand” function to set a seed value for the “rand” function, which the algorithm uses to generate a key. While the “rand” function is meant to generate random numbers, the malware author uses the “srand” function to seed the “rand” function with a static value. The static seed value causes the “rand” function to create the same values each time it is called and results in a static key to decrypt the configuration. The seed value is where the Emissary and Elise differ in their use of this algorithm, as Emissary uses a seed value of 1024 and Elise uses the seed value of 2012.\n\nWhile these two Trojans share code, we consider Emissary and Elise separate tools since their configuration structure, command handler and C2 communications channel differ. The Emissary Trojan delivered in this attack contains the components listed in Table 1. At a high level, Emissary has an initial loader DLL that extracts a configuration file and a second DLL containing Emissary’s functional code that it injects into Internet Explorer.",

Emotet may try to persuade users to click the malicious files by using tempting language about “Your Invoice,” “Payment Details,” or possibly an upcoming shipment from well-known parcel companies.\n\nEmotet has gone through a few iterations. Early versions arrived as a malicious JavaScript file. Later versions evolved to use macro-enabled documents to retrieve the virus payload from command and control (C&C) servers run by the attackers.\n\nEmotet uses a number of tricks to try and prevent detection and analysis. Notably, Emotet knows if it’s running inside a virtual machine (VM) and will lay dormant if it detects a sandbox environment, which is a tool cybersecurity researchers use to observe malware within a safe, controlled space.\n\nEmotet also uses C&C servers to receive updates. This works in the same way as the operating system updates on your PC and can happen seamlessly and without any outward signs. This allows the attackers to install updated versions of the software, install additional malware such as other banking Trojans, or to act as a dumping ground for stolen information such as financial credentials, usernames and passwords, and email addresses.",

On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework.

It takes advantage of CVE-2017-0145, which has been patched with the MS17-010 security bulletin. One might note that file sharing over SMB is normally used only within local networks and that the SMB ports are typically blocked from the internet at the firewall. However, if an attacker has access to a vulnerable endpoint running SMB, the ability to run arbitrary code in kernel context from a remote location is a serious compromise.\n\nThis exploit was written to remotely install and launch an SMB backdoor. At the core of this exploit is a type confusion vulnerability leading to an attacker offset controlled arbitrary heap write. As with almost any heap corruption exploit, the attacker must know or control the layout of the heap to consistently succeed. With SMB, most objects are allocated in the non-paged pool.",

RIPTIDE’s first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key, and the RC4 encryption key is used to encrypt all further communication.\n\nIn June 2014, Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth. The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014.\n\nFollowing the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE’s protocols and strings. We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in order to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors. The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules. FireEye dubbed this new malware family HIGHTIDE.",

The malware uses various techniques to evade detection and inhibit analysis. For example, DLL sideloading using trusted, signed executables allows the malware to execute rather seamlessly; some payloads are encrypted on disk preventing analysis, especially as decompression and decryption occurs at runtime, in-memory, where code is further altered to thwart forensic analysis.\n\nWhereas HenBox posed a threat for devices running Android, Farseer is built to target Windows, which appears to be more typical given previous threats seen from the group or groups behind this, and related malware.",

This malware will delete and overwrite files on the infected computer. Shamoon itself will meanwhile erase the master boot record of the computer, rendering it unusable.\n\nThe addition of the Filerase wiper makes these attacks more destructive than use of the Shamoon malware alone. While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files on the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the Filerase malware, recovery becomes impossible.\n\nFilerase is spread across the victim’s network from one initial computer using a list of remote computers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the attackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the intrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another tool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the computers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected machines.",

The program is being used for targeted cyber espionage in Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIts discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The last of these stated in its report that Flame 'is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.' Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN). It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.",

The coding style and techniques suggest that FlawedGrace was not written by the same developer as 'ServHelper'.\n\nFlawedGrace uses a complicated binary protocol for its command and control. It can use a configurable port for communications, but all samples we have observed to date have used port 443.

GandCrab variants caused a great deal of damage worldwide, including in South Korea.\n\nThe GandCrab ransomware shares an interesting history with AhnLab. Like many other examples of ransomware, GandCrab searches for any running or pre-installed anti‑malware program and when it finds one it interferes with its normal execution and shuts it down. However, when it came to AhnLab, GandCrab went the extra mile, specifically targeting the company and its anti-malware program V3 Lite by mentioning it in its code. It even revealed a vulnerability in the security program and made attempts to delete it entirely.\n\nTo effectively respond to and protect against GandCrab attacks, the AhnLab Security Analysis Team analysed GandCrab and all its different versions by thoroughly investigating the distributed code, encryption method, restoration method, and the evasive method it used to avoid behaviour-based detection. Each time a new attack feature targeting AhnLab and V3 was identified, the company’s product developers promptly addressed it to ensure maximum security.\n\nThe interesting conflict between AhnLab and the GandCrab ransomware was widely discussed in the IT security industry. However, the details that were revealed at the time were only the tip of the iceberg, with more details being kept private for reasons of confidentiality.",

Again, it uses the same packer that TA505 has been using.\n\nThe unpacked payload is written in C++ and basically works as a downloader for another malware. What makes Gelup different, however, is its obfuscation technique and UAC-bypassing function bymocking trusted directories (spoofing the file’s execution path in a trusted directory), abusing auto-elevated executables, and using the dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading technique.\n\nFirst, Gelup resolves most Windows application programming interfaces (APIs) by using the hash just before calling it —a common technique used by a lot of malware families. Second, the strings in Gelup’s code are decrypted at runtime.",

      "description": "Currently, we identify this malware family as “Ghambar,” due to the word being used in some function names and variables inside the same malware’s code; also subsequent samples expose potentially personally identifiable information and alternative names. While Ghambar does not seem to share any significant codebase with past tools, we believe that Ghambar might be the successor of 'TinyZBot', which is one of the artifacts described by Cylance in the Operation Cleaver report. Similar to TinyZBot, Ghambar is also developed in C# and it employs the same SOAP­based command and control protocol. While it is provided with fewer features, Ghambar appears better designed and with a cleaner code style.\n\nInterestingly, Ghambar is designed to leave as little footprint on the system as possible. When collecting screenshots, clipboard data, and intercepted keystrokes, it attempts to directly send the data to the C&C without writing on disk.\n\nWhile executing a parallel keylogger, Ghambar is also able to receive instructions from the C&C on additional tasks to execute. These tasks can be additional plugins to be downloaded and executed, generic tasks on the file system, or a number of predefined commands.\n\nGhambar is provided with a full­featured plugins system. If instructed to do so by the C&C, the malware is able to download, store, and execute any given plugin.\n\nOther than generally creating, deleting and fetching files, Ghambar is also able to executed a number of predefined commands if instructed to do so by the C&C. The commands, identified by a command­type identifier, include the following:\n• Self­destruct;\n• Execute a command through 'cmd.exe' and return output;\n• Take a screenshot;\n• Shutdown the computer;\n• Restart the computer;\n• Logoff the user;\n• Lock the computer;\n• Turn on and off the monitor;\n• Set and copy clipboard data;\n• Enable or disable mouse/keyboard (although these procedures are not yet implemented);\n• “Enable or disable desktop” (not implemented);\n• Trigger a BSOD (also, not implemented).\n\nWhile the sample we obtained might be an earlier stage still under development, Ghambar is alreadyprovided with enough features to make it a fully­functional backdoor.",

At the same time, it uses HTTPS to download Lua byte-code files, and uses DNS over HTTPS to get the C2 name to ensure secure communication between the bots, the Web Server and the C2.\n\nWe noticed that there are already 2 versions of Godlua Backdoor and there are ongoing updates. We also observed that attackers has been using Lua command to run Lua code dynamically and initiate HTTP Flood attacks targeting some websites.",

The PowerShell implant used in the Olympics campaign was a stager based on the PowerShell Empire framework that created an encrypted channel to the attacker’s server. However, this implant required additional modules to be executed to be a fully capable backdoor. In addition, the PowerShell implant did not contain a mechanism to persist beyond a simple scheduled task. Gold Dragon has a much more robust persistence mechanism than the initial PowerShell implant and enables the attacker to do much more to the target system. Gold Dragon reappeared the same day that the Olympics campaign began.",

These samples can be divided into two major groups: those that exfiltrate data via HTTP and those that exfiltrate data via SMTP, i.e., by sending exfiltrated data in file attachments of emails to an attacker-controlled mailbox using innocuous-looking subjects and mail body content. The latter technique, while appearing in the early stages of GoldenEagle development, has resurfaced in samples signed and analysed in May 2020.",

      "description": "(Trend Micro) There’s a new player in the card theft game that changes it altogether: Gorynych or the Diamond Fox botnet malware. BKDR_GORYNYCH may not technically be considered a PoS malware, as it is not entirely designed for PoS systems and is also being used outside of the Black Atlas operation. However, cybercriminals running Black Atlas have built a copy that can specifically look for the output file of the 'BlackPOS' malware, which is the one that harvested the credit card data from the targets in the first place. The fact that the images in Gorynych’s control panel were named “Kartoxa,” which also refers to BlackPoS, further proves the link between the two malware and the operation.\n\nAside from the PoS plugin, other modules usually downloaded from a subdirectory in the C&C server make up this malware’s entirety. These include plugins for getting screenshots, passwords, mails, and more. Without the plugins, Gorynych routines mostly focus on anti-analysis, information theft, and installations. In the Diamond Fox builder, the keylogger and PoS grabber functionalities are disabled by default. However, with Operation Black Atlas, these options were turned on, which proves that cybercriminals running this are intentionally targeting PoS systems.\n\nAfter downloading its plugins, Gorynych reports to its server via gate.php using HTTP POST. It uses its own user-agent that can be found in its configuration file. The parameters consist of system information used to profile the bot, mainly for identification in the Gorynych control panel. The posted information is encrypted using a simple XOR operation.",

This led to two main branches: one became known as 'Gozi v2', which was merged with Pony and became 'Vawtrak'/Neverquest.\n\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\n\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: 'IAP'. The panel's login page comes with the title 'Login - IAP'. The body contains 'AUTHORIZATION', 'Name:', 'Password:' and a single button 'Sign in' in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the ''DreamBot'' gate.\n\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\n\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and 'Nymaim' was detected. This breed became known as 'GozNym'. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run. The C2 communication is performed by Nymaim.",

It appears that the operators of Nymaim have recompiled its source code with part of the Gozi ISFB source code, creating a combination that is being actively used in attacks against more than 24 U.S. and Canadian banks, stealing millions of dollars so far. X-Force named this new hybrid GozNym.\n\nThe new GozNym hybrid takes the best of both the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware to create a powerful Trojan. From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers. The end result is a new banking Trojan in the wild.\n\nInternally, GozNym works like a double-headed beast, where the two codes rely on one another to carry out the malware’s internal operations.",

Interestingly, while most Blue Lambert variants have version numbers in the range of 2.x, Green Lambert is mostly in 3.x versions. This stands in opposition to the data gathered from export timestamps and C&C domain activity that points to Green Lambert being considerably older than the Blue variant. Perhaps both Blue and Green Lamberts have been developed in parallel by two different teams working under the same umbrella, as normal software version iterations, with one seeing earlier deployment than the other.\n\nSignatures created for Green Lambert (Windows) have also triggered on an OS X variant of Green Lambert, with a very low version number: 1.2.0. This was uploaded to a multiscanner service in September 2014. The OS X variant of Green Lambert is in many regards functionally identical to the Windows version, however it misses certain functionality such as running plugins directly in memory.",

      "description": "(ESET) This malware requires administrator privileges, which must already have been obtained before this stage is reached. According to our research, the GreyEnergy actors deploy this backdoor mainly on two types of endpoints: servers with high uptime, and workstations used to control ICS environments.\n\nTo make communication with command and control (C&C) servers stealthier, the malicious actors may deploy additional software on internal servers in the compromised network, so each server would act as a proxy. Such a proxy C&C redirects requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server on the internet. This way, it might be less suspicious to a defender who notices that multiple computers are “talking” to an internal server, rather than to a remote server. This technique can be also used by attackers to control the malware in different segments of a compromised network. A similar technique using internal servers as C&C proxies was used by the Duqu 2.0 APT.\n\nIf an affected organization has public-facing web servers connected to an internal network, the attackers may deploy “backup” backdoors onto these servers. These backdoors are used to regain access to the network in the event that the main backdoors are detected and removed.",

Specifically, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke’s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on 'CozyDuke' victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them.\n\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image files that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute.\n\nHammerDuke’s use of Twitter and crafted image files is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both 'OnionDuke' and 'MiniDuke' also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image files contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions.",

      "description": "Havex is a remote access trojan (RAT) that was discovered in 2013 as part of a widespread espionage campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS) used across numerous industries and attributed to a hacking group referred to as 'Dragonfly' and 'Energetic Bear'. Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\n\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\n\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems. However, the data collected by Havex would have aided efforts to design and develop attacks against specific targets or industries.",

Our analysis of the two campaigns revealed that Sakabota is the predecessor to Hisoka, which was first observed in May 2019.\n\nDuring our analysis, we identified two different versions of Hisoka, specifically v0.8 and v0.9, both installed onto the network of two Kuwait organizations. Both versions contain command sets that allow the actor to control a compromised system. In both versions, the actor can communicate via a command and control (C2) channel that uses either HTTP or DNS tunneling. However, v0.9 also added the ability for an email-based C2 channel as well.\n\nThe email-based C2 communications capability added to Hisoka v0.9 relies on Exchange Web Services (EWS) to use a legitimate account on an Exchange server in order to allow the actor to communicate with Hisoka. The malware attempts to log into an Exchange server using supplied credentials and uses EWS to send and receive emails in order to establish communications between the target and the actor. However, the communications channel does not actually send and receive emails like other email-based C2 channels we have seen in the past. Instead, the channel relies on creating email drafts that the Hisoka malware and the actor will process in order to exchange data back and forth. By using email drafts as well as the same legitimate Exchange account to communicate, no emails will be detected outbound or received inbound.\n\nWithin two hours of gaining access to the system through Hisoka, the actor deployed two additional tools named 'Gon' and 'EYE', whose names were based on the filenames Gon.sys and EYE.exe.",

The main purpose of the IGT tool is to make an inventory of the system, saving information from the network interfaces and addresses, credentials belonging to the Domain and database server, services being run from the OS and everything that could help the Poseidon Group make its attack more customized to its victim.",

To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).\n\nThese switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches; technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well. Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning of vital services.\n\nIndustroyer’s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the attackers didn’t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach the malware “to speak” those protocols.",

A number of bugs (some of which I've mentioned in this blog post) show a lack of sophistication and, possibly, a rush on the author's part. There are a number of artifacts that link this malware family to others we've seen. The blacklist of process names is extremely similar to the ones discovered in the 'Alina POS' malware family. Additionally, the installation path very much reminds me of the early 'Dexter' variants. It's certainly likely that because these malware families' code has been leaked online, the author used at least some of this code as a basis for JackPOS. While the malware technically has a command and control (C&C) component to it, overall it's quite limited and not nearly as robust as other examples seen in the past. I mentioned originally that I wanted to see if JackPOS brought something special to the table. I'm going to have to answer that question with a resounding 'no' in this particular case. However, while this family does not bring any innovative characteristics to the POS malware scene, as history has taught us, it should still very much be considered a real threat.",

While detailed targeting information is not currently available, we believe Komplex has been used in attacks on individuals related to the aerospace industry, as well as attacks leveraging an exploit in MacKeeper to deliver the Trojan. The Komplex Trojan revealed a design similar to Sofacy’s 'JHUHUGIT' variant Trojan, which we believe may have been done in order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative ease.",

This attack was unusual for a DDoS attack because it did not use a command and control (C&C) server; the commands were hidden inside the threat itself. The use of a tactic like this indicated a growth in sophistication from the group compared to the 2009 attacks. Symantec research into this threat also found that, as well as carrying out a DDoS attack, if the infected computers were not cleared of this Trojan the master boot record (MBR) of some of them would be destroyed within 10 days.",

      "description": "(Talos) Attackers' trends tend to come and go. But one popular technique we're seeing at this time is the use of living-off-the-land binaries — or 'LoLBins'. LoLBins are used by different actors combined with fileless malware and legitimate cloud services to improve chances of staying undetected within an organisation, usually during post-exploitation attack phases.\n\nLiving-off-the-land tactics mean that attackers are using pre-installed tools to carry out their work. This makes it more difficult for defenders to detect attacks and researchers to identify the attackers behind the campaign. In the attacks we're seeing, there are binaries supplied by the victim's operating system that are normally used for legitimate purposes, but in these cases, are being abused by the attackers.\n\n(LOLBAS Project) The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.\n\nA LOLBin/Lib/Script must:\n\n• Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.\n• Have extra 'unexpected' functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases.\no Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses\n• Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team\n\nInteresting functionality can include:\n\n• Executing code\no Arbitrary code execution\no Pass-through execution of other programs (unsigned) or scripts (via a LOLBin)\n• Compiling code\n• File operations\no Downloading\no Upload\no Copy\n• Persistence\no Pass-through persistence utilizing existing LOLBin\no Persistence (e.g. hide data in ADS, execute at logon)\n• UAC bypass\n• Credential theft\n• Dumping process memory\n• Surveillance (e.g. keylogger, network trace)\n• Log evasion/modification\n• DLL side-loading/hijacking without being relocated elsewhere in the filesystem.",

Instead, the binary only goes as far as encoding the RSA public key that is used in its later stages for file encryption. It’s possible to speculate that the attackers may have already been fully aware of the target companies’ security measures, and were therefore confident that their malware would not be intercepted even without any obfuscation.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the malware uses open-source Boost libraries for its filesystem, and inter-process communication and Crypto++ (Cryptopp) for file encryption. One of the advantages of using these libraries is easier development and implementation since developers only need to work with wrapper functions instead of calling individual native APIs to achieve the same goal. And since this utilizes a higher level of programming, statically and dynamically analysing the application without source code is more complicated than just reading a straight sequence of Windows APIs. However, since they do not use standard libraries, they need to be manually linked and the functions need to be physically added to the final binary, which results a larger file size than usual.",

This 'injection' behavior is aggressive even by the standard of the 'Zeus' family: very few malware families exhibit such an aggressive behavior, and it is particularly unusual to observe this in key loggers, even commercial ones.

A single configuration file, jer.dll, is dropped, and it contains base64-encoded text that corresponds to AES-encrypted strings.\nGoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.\nRegarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi access points.

      "description": "(Kaspersky) If a Microsoft Office vulnerability is successfully exploited, the exploit creates an executable PE file on the hard drive and launches it for execution. The malicious program is a platform used to deploy extra (add-on) malicious modules, store them stealthily and thus add new capabilities for the threat actors. The attack unfolds in several stages, as described below:\n\n1. The exploit is activated, and an appropriate (32-bit or 64-bit) version of the malicious program is installed on the victim computer, depending on the type of operating system installed on it. To do this installation, malicious code is injected into the system process ‘explorer.exe’ rather than into its memory. The malicious program has a modular structure: its main body is stored in the registry, while its add-on modules are downloaded following the instruction arriving from the C&C server. DLL hijacking (use of a modified system library) is used to ensure that the main module is launched each time the system is rebooted.\n2. The main module of the malicious program receives an instruction to download and launch add-on modules, which opens new capabilities for the threat actors.\n3. The malicious add-on modules provide opportunities to control the victim system, take screenshots of windows and intercept information entered from the keyboard. We have seen them in other cyber-espionage campaigns as well.\n4. The threat actors use PowerSploit, a modified set of PowerShell scripts, and various utilities to steal files and passwords found on the victim computer.\n\nThe cybercriminals were primarily interested in .doc, .ppt, .xls, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .txt and .rtf files on the victim computers. The harvested files were packed into a password-protected archive and sent to the threat actors’ server.\n\nOverall, the tactics, techniques and procedures that the cybercriminals used in their attacks can hardly be considered complicated or expensive. However, there were a few things that caught our eye:\n\n• The payload (at least one of the modules) is delivered using some simple steganography. Within traffic, it looks like a download of a regular JPEG image; however, the encrypted payload is loaded immediately after the image data. Microcin searches for a special ‘ABCD’ label in such a file; it is followed by a special structure, after which the payload comes, to be decrypted by Microcin. This way, new, platform-independent code and/or PE files can be delivered.\n• If the Microcin installer detects the processes of some anti-malware programs running in the system, then, during installation, it skips the step of injecting into ‘explorer.exe’, and the modified system library used for establishing the malicious program within the system is placed into the folder %WINDIR%; to do this, the system app ‘wusa.exe’ is used with the parameter “/extract” (on operating systems with UAC).",

The backdoor hooks Windows APIs to prevent the victim from seeing the TeamViewer application. By default, MINEBRIDGE conducts command and control (C2) communication via HTTPS POST requests to hard-coded C2 domains. The POST requests contain a GUID derived from the system’s volume serial number, a TeamViewer unique id and password, username, computer name, operating system version, and beacon interval. MINEBRIDGE can also communicate with a C2 server by sending TeamViewer chat messages using a custom window procedure hook. Collectively, the two C2 methods support commands for downloading and executing payloads, downloading arbitrary files, self-deletion and updating, process listing, shutting down and rebooting the system, executing arbitrary shell commands, process elevation, turning on/off TeamViewer's microphone, and gathering system UAC information.\n\nMINEBRIDGE’s default method of communication is sending HTTPS POST requests over TCP port 443. This method of communication is always active; however, the beacon-interval time may be changed via a command. Before sending any C2 beacons, the sample waits to collect the TeamViewer generated unique id (<tv_id>) and password (<tv_pass>) via SetWindowsTextW hooks.",

Additionally, a specific loader is often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nWhile the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with 'CosmicDuke' and 'PinchDuke'. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nTwo details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly during the ‘old days‘ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C&C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&C server responds) is a feature also found in 'OnionDuke', 'CozyDuke', and 'HammerDuke'.",

All C2 communications are encrypted with the AES algorithm using a key generated by computing five MD5 hashes starting with the key “1qazxcvbnm”, and adding a salt value of “.)1/” in each iteration.\n\nThe C2 server will respond to requests from MobileOrder with commands that the Trojan refers to as “orders”. MobileOrder contains a command handler with functionality that provides a fairly robust set of commands, as seen in Table 6. The first byte of data provided by the C2 server is order number, which is followed by the encrypted data that needed to carry out the specific order.",

Each component of this modular program performs a certain action: searches for payment orders and modifies them, replaces original payment details with fraudulent ones, and then erases traces. The success of replacement is due to the fact that at this stage the payment order has not yet been signed, which will occur after payment details are replaced. In addition to hiding the tracks, the concealment module again substitutes the fraudulent payment details in a debit advice after the transaction back with the original ones. This means that the payment order is sent and accepted for execution with the fraudulent payment details, and the responses come as if the payment details were the initial ones. This gives cybercriminals extra time to mule funds before the theft is detected.",

The malware steals ATM transaction data using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and keylogs user input from specific application windows. This stolen data can be sold in deep web markets for use in creating counterfeit payment cards and carrying out fraudulent fund transfers out of victims’ accounts. Because no cash is stolen from the ATM, the compromise tends to remain undetected for prolonged periods and thus allows the criminal group behind NeoPocket to collect large amounts of sensitive data.",

If only one core is detected, it quits. This probably is an attempt to detect virtualized environments such as sandboxes, as well as other analysis environments used by reverse engineers, which often tend to be configured with a single core. If the CPU core check detects more than one core, it implants the 'NewCT2' RAT in %temp%\\MSSoap.DLL(some variants will use BurnDCSrv.DLL and IntelAMTPP.DLL) and executes the written file.",

In addition, njRAT is still a malware family that is being actively distributed via various methods such as spear-phishing, malvertising, exploit kits and other techniques. Figure 1 shows a screenshot for the njRAT Panel Menu.\n\nDepending on the configuration taken from the attackers in njRAT panel, the features it provided can be used to perform malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data/information, disabling security software, install additional malicious payload to the victim’s computer and many more harmful actions. Upon the execution of njRAT, it will connect to the command and control (C&C) server, allowing the attacker to perform malicious activity on the victim’s machine.\n\nOther than that, it will create copies of itself in the %Temp% folder and rename itself by masquerading as a legitimate binary. In this example it was renamed to ‘svhost.exe’ which is trying to imitate ‘svchost.exe’. Furthermore, it tries to hide its persistence from the user by setting the file attributes as ‘Hidden’ onto the original and the copy of the binary.\n\nMoreover, it will also make a copy of itself in the “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu” folder and create or modify the registry key for persistence to ensure it will be executed on startup.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).",

This variant of the Petya malware—referred to as NotPetya—encrypts files with extensions from a hard-coded list. Additionally, if the malware gains administrator rights, it encrypts the master boot record (MBR), making the infected Windows computers unusable. NotPetya differs from previous Petya malware primarily in its propagation methods.\n\nNotPetya leverages multiple propagation methods to spread within an infected network. According to malware analysis, NotPetya attempts the lateral movement techniques below:\n\n• 'PsExec' - a legitimate Windows administration tool\n• WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation, a legitimate Windows component\n• 'EternalBlue' - the same Windows SMBv1 exploit used by 'WannaCry'\n• 'EternalRomance' - another Windows SMBv1 exploit",

We couldn´t find any legitimate software that this malware appears to be impersonating; in fact, we don´t believe it exists. The Trojan uses third-party Delphi libraries like The Indy Project for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower Abbrevia (sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia) for compression.

The code is capable of logging GET and POST requests, grabbing full pages, terminating connections and injecting data into Web pages.\n\nAll logged requests and grabbed pages are sent to the C&C server in real time, allowing fraudsters to perform session hijacks — also in real time but hidden from the legitimate user of the online bank account. By tapping the session ID token, which banks use to identify a user’s online banking session, the fraudsters can electronically impersonate the legitimate user and complete a range of banking operations.",

This second malware infection is capable of running payloads solely in the memory, effectively enabling it to stealthily run in the background.",

From a technical perspective, the purpose of the malware is to deliver and start the wiper payload which attempts to destroy files on the remote network shares over the next 60 minutes. Meanwhile, the main module collects user passwords from browser and Windows storage and crafts a new generation of the worm that contains old and freshly collected compromised credentials. The new generation of the worm is pushed to accessible local network computers and starts using the PsExec tool, leveraging the collected credentials and current user privileges.\n\nOnce the wiper has run for 60 minutes it cleans Windows event logs, resets backups, deletes shadow copies from the file system, disables the recovery item in the Windows boot menu, disables all the services on the system and reboots the computer. Those files on the network shares that it managed to wipe within 60 minutes remain destroyed. The malware doesn’t use any persistence and even contains protection (also a killswitch) against recurring reinfection. Incidentally, only 1MB of the remote files are fully overwritten with zeroes; larger files were wiped with just 1K of zeroes in the header. The local files are not destroyed and the worm doesn’t wipe itself or its components.",

The Tor node would intercept any unencrypted executable files being downloaded and modify those executables by adding a malicious wrapper contained an embedded OnionDuke. Once the victim finished downloading the file and executed it, the wrapper would infect the victim’s computer with OnionDuke before executing the original legitimate executable.\n\nThe same wrapper has also been used to wrap legitimate executable files, which were then made available for users to download from torrent sites. Again, if a victim downloaded a torrent containing a wrapped executable, they would get infected with OnionDuke.\n\nFinally, we have also observed victims being infected with OnionDuke after they were already infected with 'CozyDuke'.

The project is now closed, according to this “press release” issued, and a license-free version available for download, as well as software development tools and documentation.

Data, such as files requested via a command of the backdoor, is exfiltrated in specially-crafted PDF documents attached to emails, and commands are also received in PDF attachments. Thus, its behavior is particularly stealthy. It is important to note that no vulnerabilities were used either in PDF readers nor in Outlook. What actually happens is that the malware is able to decode data from the PDF documents and interpret it as commands for the backdoor.",

Once the phone is exploited and Pegasus is installed, it begins contacting the operator’s command and control (C&C) servers to receive and execute operators’ commands, and send back the target’s private data, including passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages, and live voice calls from popular mobile messaging apps.

The attack tool takes us further into the set alongside the 'Uroburos' rootkit and components first associated with this actor a couple years ago. We suspect that this component was running for years at a victim site, but do not have concrete data to support that statement just yet.\n\nThe Linux Turla module is a C/C++ executable statically linked against multiple libraries, greatly increasing its file size. It was stripped of symbol information, more likely intended to increase analysis effort than to decrease file size. Its functionality includes hidden network communications, arbitrary remote command execution, and remote management. Much of its code is based on public sources.",

Once Peppy successfully communicates to its C&C, the keylogging and exfiltration of files using configurable search parameters begins. Files are exfiltrated using HTTP POST requests.\n\nIn addition to keylogging and the exfiltration of files, Peppy is also capable of accepting commands from its C&C to update itself, disable itself, exfiltrate a specific file, uninstall itself, execute a shell command, take screenshots, spawn a reverse shell, and download a remote file and execute it.",

It also takes pictures, captures screenshots, records audios, intercepts and sends SMS messages. In addition, it can log the keyboard input by the Android accessibility service, acting as a keylogger.\n\nPluginPhantom is a new class of Google Android Trojan: it is the first to use updating and to evade static detection. It does this by leveraging the Android plugin technology. It abuses the legitimate and popular open source framework “DroidPlugin”, which allows an app to dynamically launch any apps as plugins without installing them in the system. PluginPhantom implements each element of malicious functionality as a plugin, and utilizes a host app to control the plugins. With the new architecture, PluginPhantom achieves more flexibility to update its modules without reinstalling apps. PluginPhantom also gains the ability to evade the static detection by hiding malicious behaviors in plugins. Since the plugin development pattern is generic and the plugin SDK can be easily embedded, the plugin architecture could be a trend among Android malware in the future.",

If this request fails, the malware will attempt to extract proxy details and credentials from Windows Protected storage, and from the IE Credentials store using publicly known methods, using the proxy credentials for subsequent requests if they enable outbound HTTP access. An initial request is then made to the hard-coded C2 server and initial URI – forming a URL of the form (in this sample) http://login.stream-media.net/files/xx11/index.asp?95027775, where the numerical parameter represents a random integer.

The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called “Evil Eye” reported by Volexity.

POSHSPY's use of WMI to both store and persist the backdoor code makes it nearly invisible to anyone not familiar with the intricacies of WMI. Its use of a PowerShell payload means that only legitimate system processes are utilized and that the malicious code execution can only be identified through enhanced logging or in memory. The backdoor's infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult. Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert.\n\nMandiant initially identified an early variant of the POSHSPY backdoor deployed as PowerShell scripts during an incident response engagement in 2015. Later in that same engagement, the attacker updated the deployment of the backdoor to use WMI for storage and persistence. Mandiant has since identified POSHSPY in several other environments compromised by APT29 over the past two years.",

This establishes persistence by creating a shortcut (using the dropped icon) in the Windows startup folder pointing to the VBE startup script.\n• Finally, on stage 2, the actual malware implant used to take control of the victim’s machine. It connects to one of the dead drop resolvers to get the address of the real C&C server and enters a loop that looks for orders every few seconds.\n• Upon system restart, the VBE startup script – which closely resembles stage 0 – is automatically executed, once again leading all the way to Powersing stage 2.\n\nCommunications with the C&C server involve the exchange of JSON-encoded objects. Powersing only has two tasks:\n\n• Capture periodic screenshots from the victim’s machine, which are immediately sent to the C&C server (two built-in commands allow operators to change screenshot quality and periodicity)\n• Execute arbitrary Powershell scripts provided by the C&C",

That’s how the crooks obtained the card data. Basically, when you pay at a local shop whose POS terminal is infected, your card data is transferred right away to the criminals.\n\nHowever, having the card data is just half the battle; to steal money, they also needed to be able to clone cards, a process made more complicated by the chips and their multiple authentications.\n\nThe Prilex group developed a whole infrastructure that lets its “customers” create cloned cards — which in theory shouldn’t be possible.",

      "description": "(Trustwave) During a recent United States Secret Service investigation, Trustwave encountered a new family of POS malware, that we named Punkey. It appears to have evolved from the 'NewPosThings' family of malware first discovered by Dennis Schwarz and Dave Loftus at Arbor Networks. While this malware shares some commonalities with that family, it departs from the standard operating procedure of the previous versions rather dramatically. In a blog post, TrendMicro also detailed recently compiled versions of the NewPOSthings family that bear a closer resemblance to NewPOSthings than Punkey. This suggests that multiple actors may be using similar source code, or the malware is being customized as a service for targeted campaigns.",

The C&C URL and other parameters such as the AES key and IV used to encrypt all network communications are specified at the beginning of the script.\n\nThe C&C server can also send backdoor commands in JSON format. The commands implemented in this version of PyFlash are:\n• Download additional files from a given HTTP(S) link.\n• Execute a Windows command using the Python function subprocess32.Popen.\n• Change the execution delay: modifies the Windows task that regularly (every X minutes; 5 by default) launches the malware.\n• Kill (uninstall) the malware.",

Win32/Qadars uses a wide variety of webinjects, some with Android mobile components, used to bypass online banking security and to gain access to user’s bank account. Usually, banking Trojans either target a broad array of financial institutions or focus on a much smaller subset, usually institutions of which the user base is geographically close.

It sends simple GET requests containing a backdoor identifier and optional victim machine information, then reads orders located in the cookie header of the reply. Orders come in the form of two-letter codes (e.g.: “xe” to list drives) which tend to vary between samples. As of today, this family is still in active development, and we have observed code refactoring as well as incremental upgrades over 2020. For instance, earlier backdoor responses were sent as base64-encoded payloads in POST requests. They are now compressed beforehand, and additionally supplied through the cookie header.",

HackingTeam is an Italian software company that created RCS, which they describe as “the hacking suite for governmental interception”. In July 2015, news emerged that HackingTeam had been breached. One of the consequences of this incident was the then latest version of RCS Galileo being leaked to the public.\n\nAs a result of the leak, both the source code and the ready-made installers for the RCS platform were made available for anyone to use. Based on our analysis of Callisto Group’s usage of RCS Galileo, we believe the Callisto Group did not utilize the leaked RCS Galileo source code, but rather used the leaked ready-made installers to set up their own installation of the RCS Galileo platform. The process for using the leaked installers to set up an RCS Galileo installation has been described online in publicly available blogposts, making the process trivial to achieve.",

The sample analyzed installed a service called “rdpclip.” The installer script executes the malware using the /install parameter. The malware then passes function cc_data_scraper_main to StartServiceCtrlDispatcher. The cc_data_scraper_main function registers itself to handle service control requests using RegisterServiceCtrlHandler.

This approach, coupled with multiple routes for the exfiltration of stolen data, such as legitimate email channels and DNS, enables Remsec to conduct secretive, long-term spying campaigns in target networks.\n\nRemsec gives the impression of being an experienced and traditional actor that has put considerable effort into learning from other extremely advanced actors, including 'Duqu', 'Flame', Equation and 'Regin'; adopting some of their most innovative techniques and improving on their tactics in order to remain undiscovered.",

      "description": "(GovCERT.ch) Recently, some anti-virus companies and newspapers reported that Retefe is distributing the Signal App (a secure messenger). Rumours say that the threat actor may use the Signal App as a communication channel with the victim. This is not the case. As a matter of fact, the Signal App is just decoy that the Retefe Gang serves to IP addresses who are not geo located in Switzerland and whose user agent does not correspond to an Android device. If the accessing IP address uses an Android user agent and is geographically located in Switzerland, the APK server will serve an Android trojan that the Retefe gang use to commit e-banking fraud.\n\nThe trojan is an SMS stealer which allows the threat actor to steal text messages sent by the bank to the customer for two factor authentication (2FA) and transaction signing (so called mobile TAN or mTAN). To have the victim install the android trojan, the Retefe gang uses social engineering to convince the victim to either enter his mobile phone number where he then receives an SMS from the threat actor with a link to the Android APK, or to scan a QR code displayed by the threat actor in the fake e-banking portal, which also leads to the Android APK. But the Android trojan is more than just an SMS stealer. It is also able to send text messages to other victim’s and uses a sophisticated anti VM detection technique. Unlike Retefe itself, which doesn’t have any botnet C&C channel, the SMS stealer has such one. It uses two hard coded botnet C&Cs which are usually hosted on compromised websites.",

The similarities between the PowerShell and C# variants of RogueRobin suggests that the DarkHydrus group ported their code to a compiled variant.\n\nThe C# variant of RogueRobin attempts to detect if it is executing in a sandbox environment using the same commands as in the PowerShell variant of RogueRobin. The series of commands, as seen in Table 2, include checks for virtualized environments, low memory, and processor counts, in addition to checks for common analysis tools running on the system. The Trojan also checks to see if a debugger is attached to its processes and will exit if it detects the presence of a debugger.",

At a minimum, each family that is built upon R-C1 must provide an interface to their specific communications abstraction and a method by which to activate the R-C1 functionality.\n\nThe general flow of execution for families that use R-C1 is as follows:\n1. Dynamically load API functions\n2. Perform any configuration management tasks that the family may require (e.g., loading the configuration, opening listening ports, establishing persistence)\n3. Establish a communication channel with controlling endpoint\n4. Pass off the channel to the R-C1 component\n\nThere are five known families that are based on, or that incorporate, R-C1 (Figure 2-1): 'RomeoAlfa', 'RomeoBravo', 'RomeoCharlie', 'RomeoHotel', and 'RomeoNovember'. In addition to the four families having commonality through the use of R-C1, two of the families, 'RomeoAlfa' and 'RomeoHotel', share the distinctive fake TLS communication scheme and use the Caracachs encryption scheme as their underlying communication encryption. 'RomeoBravo', 'RomeoCharlie', and 'RomeoNovember' use DNSCALC-style encoding for communication encryption.",

There are two observed variants, RomeoCharlie-One and RomeoCharlie-Two. The differences between the two are cosmetic in nature.\n\nWith the configuration of the RomeoCharlie variants loaded into memory, the differences between RomeoCharlie-One and RomeoCharlie-Two cease (save for one exception that will be explained). RomeoCharlie is a server-mode RAT and, as such, must establish a listening port. Before a listening port is established at the Winsock level, RomeoCharlie first opens a hole in the Windows Firewall to allow incoming connections on the desired listening port (as specified in the configuration).

Despite the lack of network sophistication, RomeoFoxtrot provides a large number of commands to handle aspects of file management, process management, network proxying, and victim computer information enumeration.\n<b />There are two known variants of RomeoFoxtrot: RomeoFoxtrot-One and RomeoFoxtrot-Two. The RomeoFoxtrot family has been observed as the payload of the IndiaCharlie variants, with IndiaCharlie-One observed dropping RomeoFoxtrot-One and IndiaCharlie-Two observed dropping RomeoFoxtrot-Two. Functionally, the two variants are very similar with only two distinctions. The primary distinction is the inclusion of a configuration file for RomoeFoxtrot-Two that specifies the listening port, while RomeoFoxtrot-One uses a hardcoded value. The second is a renumbering of command identifiers. Given the similarities, the remainder of this section will simply refer to them equally as RomeoFoxtrot unless a particular detail is specific to one variant over the other.",

While other POS malware families are perfectly capable of sending captured Track1 and Track2 data to a C2 server, RtPOS merely saves the data locally. As this activity is similar to some POS utilities, this is likely intended to reduce the network activity footprint of RtPOS and ensure the malware remains undetected for longer, thus earning the controllers a healthier profit. The RtPOS malware is also simplistic in features, largely automated in operation, and lacks many of the features that more mature POS malware families do.\n\nThe lack of a network exfiltration feature, interaction and user commands, as well as a dropper component hints at more serious implications: in order for RtPOS to execute and in order to retrieve the captured payment card data, the attackers would have existing access to the victim’s machine(s). RtPOS may simply be an in-development POS malware family, though review and analysis suggests RtPOS is a post-compromise tool instead of a standalone malware, and may even be part of a larger, heretofore unidentified tool set.",

During our analysis, we were able to acquire two plugin packages, named “'Bourbon'.jar” and “'IceCube'.jar” which added functionality including exfiltrating SMS text messages, address books, and call logs, and spying on the target through their phone’s camera, microphone, and GPS.",

This makes the traffic look like it comes from a real user visiting a blog with a regular web browser. In fact, the page is not being displayed at all on the infected system; the Trojan just decodes the information within the comments and is able to understand the commands the attacker is sending. On a cursory look to the actual blog, a visitor would never spot any of this, since the comments are never displayed on the browser either.\n\nThis is a perfect vehicle for these attackers, who are trying to stay undetected for as long as possible. ShadyRAT was the first major targeted attack that was spotted in the wild, and this technique was possibly a contributing factor. The network traffic looks perfectly tame to any traffic observer or security device.\n\nOn top of this, ShadyRAT was also able to decrypt and decode C&C commands hidden within JPG files using the LSB technique as seen in the first entry of this series.

Once executed, themalware first attempts to disable the 'System Event Notification' and 'Alerter' services.\n\nNote: The Alerter service is present in Windows XP and Windows 2003, which are no longer supported by Microsoft.  Current operating systems supported by Microsoft do not run the Alerter service.\n\nNext, the malware overwrites the MBR, displaying a status in the command (CMD) window.  If the malware is able to overwrite the MBR, an 'OK' status is displayed in the CMD window. If the malware is unable to overwrite the MBR, a 'Fail' status is displayed.\n\nAfter the MBR is overwritten, the malware attempts to gain access to physical and network drives attached to the victim's system and recursively enumerate through the drive’s contents. When the malware identifies a file, it overwrites the file's contents with NULL bytes, renames the file with a randomly generated file name, then deletes the file, making forensic recovery impossible.\n\nIf the malware is able to overwrite, rename and delete the file, the CMD window will display a 'Break>' status.  If the malware is only able to delete the file, the CMD window will display a 'Del>' status.\n\nOnce the malware has completed deleting files, the system is rebooted.

However, a more in-depth analysis revealed that the d3d11.dll sample implanted a skeleton key, where adversaries could persistently control (before the system reboot) the infected machine and machines under the infected AD. More specifically, the malware was an account manipulation tool that contained code extracted from both Dumpert and 'Mimikatz'. We called this malware SkeletonKeyInjector. The malware employed a technique that altered the NTLM authentication program and implanted a skeleton key to allow adversaries to log-in without a valid credential. This allowed the adversary to achieve the following objectives:\n● Persistence: After the code in memory was altered, the adversary could gain access to the compromised machines before the next system reboot. As AD machines are rarely rebooted, the adversary was able to control the machines for a very long time.\n● Defense Evasion: Aside from the different login password and login algorithm scheme, there was no difference when compared to a normal login activity. Furthermore, normal users could still log-in to the system via their original password. Thus, the probability of being exposed was low.\n● Lateral Movement: Adversaries could use the skeleton key to login to other machines that were in the same domain. This made it easier for an adversary to conduct lateral movement.",

Not only that, it interacts with several other modules including a ring-0 loader, kernel-mode network sniffer, own base-independent packer, and virtual filesystem, among others.\n\nFollowing infection, Slingshot would load a number of modules onto the victim device, including two huge and powerful ones: 'Cahnadr', the kernel mode module, and 'GollumApp', a user mode module. The two modules are connected and able to support each other in information gathering, persistence and data exfiltration.",

After some quick initialization, the backdoor XORs an embedded string with 0x9D to extract the IP address of the C&C server. Subsequently it establishes a connection to it (generally on port 80) and checks in with some basic information about the system.\n\nAfter the check-in message is sent, the malware enters a continuous loop in which it will keep silently waiting for commands from the open socket connection. From now on, it expects some manual interaction from the attacker.\n\nThe supported commands are:\n• shell\n• comd\n• sleep\n• quit\n• kill",

As described by FireEye, Speculoos was delivered by exploiting CVE-2019-19781, a vulnerability affecting the Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliances that allowed an adversary to remotely execute arbitrary commands.\n\nBased on the spread of industries and regions, in addition to the timing of the vulnerability disclosure, we believe this campaign may have been more opportunistic in nature compared to the highly targeted attack campaigns that are often associated with these types of adversaries. However, considering the exploitation of the vulnerability in conjunction with delivery of a backdoor specifically designed to execute on the associated FreeBSD operating system indicates the adversary was absolutely targeting the affected devices.",

Once successfully executed, the corresponding process then attempts to retrieve the second-stage payload.\n\nThe second-stage instruction attempts to obfuscate its activity by retrieving a payload that appears to be an image file, but upon further inspection appears actually to be a portable executable.\n\nThe C2 server replaces the first two bytes, which are normally ‘MZ’, with the characters ‘DW’, which may allow this C2 activity to evade rudimentary network security solutions and thus increase the success rate of retrieval.\n\nOnce downloaded, the dropper will replace the initial two bytes prior to executing it. This second stage payload will once again perform process hollowing against a randomly selected Windows executable located in the system32 folder.",

Upon execution, it will first brute force its own decryption key (a 32-bit value, meaning this takes a fraction of second on modern PCs) before using this to decrypt the main program code.\n\nCode-wise the POS component is very similar to the loader, except there is no additional encryption, as whenever it is delivered the operators are almost certain -due to the pre-filtering above- that a valuable target has been identified.\nThis component works like any other POS memory scraper: opening processes based on either a predefined black or whitelist of process names, creating a new thread for each matching one and scanning their full memory range for Track 1 and Track 2 credit card data. If such data is found, first it will be verified by the Luhn algorithm for integrity, then it will be encrypted by a pre-defined key (another 32 or 64-bit value stored in the POS binary itself) and either sent to yet another C2 identified, again, by IP/port combination or it will be saved locally.",

The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception.

The code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with the loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server.\n\nThe secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is embedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor wants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that will be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. Commands supported by the payload are execution of programs, up-, download and deletion of files and capability to manipulate MAC timestamps.",

At the time of writing, it's unclear whether the malware is currently being used in campaigns in the wild, although the coordinated use of LogMeIn-themed filenames and C2 URLs, coupled with evidence of an earlier Intel-themed variant, suggest that it may well be.",

If the link file becomes corrupted, the updater.mod module restores it.\n\nIn this campaign the C2 servers were mostly based on cloud storage at mydrive.ch. For every victim, the operators created a new account there and uploaded additional malware modules and a configuration file with commands to execute it. Once executed, the updater.mod module connected to the C2 and performed the following actions:\n• downloaded the command file to the working directory;\n• uploaded files collected and prepared by additional malicious modules (if any) to the C2. These files were located in a directory called ‘queue’ or ‘ntfsrecover’ in the working directory. Files in this directory could have one of two extensions: .d or .upd depending on whether they had already been uploaded to the server or not.\n• downloaded additional malware modules:\no 'dfrgntfs5.sqt' – a module for executing commands from the C2;\no 'msvcrt58.sqt' – a module for stealing mail credentials and emails;\no 'zl4vq.sqt' – legitimate zlib library used by dfrgntfs5;\no %victim_ID%.upe – optional plug-in for dfrgntfs5.

Moreover, this function copies certain files into the USB %RECYCLER% folder, monitors files’ modified time, and updates the newest one to the USB device.

The program also stops processes that could be locking important files, such as Microsoft Exchange and SQL Server. Files are encrypted with a combination of AES-256 in ECB mode and RSA-2048. In our initial report published at the time we noted two peculiarities with this program’s implementation:\n• The ransomware uses Mersenne Twister as a source of randomness, but unfortunately for the victims the RNG is reseeded every time new data is consumed. Still, this is unorthodox cryptography, as is the decision to use the “electronic codebook” (ECB) mode for the AES algorithm. The combination of ECB and AES is not semantically secure, which means the patterns of the original clear data are preserved upon encryption. This was reiterated by cybersecurity researchers who analyzed Zoom security in April 2020.\n• VHD implements a mechanism to resume operations if the encryption process is interrupted. For files larger than 16MB, the ransomware stores the current cryptographic materials on the hard drive, in clear text. This information is not deleted securely afterwards, which implies there may be a chance to recover some of the files.",

Therefore, it is possible that additional HIDDEN COBRA malware may be present on network infrastructure compromised with Volgmer.\n\nAs a backdoor Trojan, Volgmer has several capabilities including: gathering system information, updating service registry keys, downloading and uploading files, executing commands, terminating processes, and listing directories. In one of the samples received for analysis, the US-CERT Code Analysis Team observed botnet controller functionality.",

It also contains the hard disk identification code found at www.winsim.com/diskid32/diskid32.cpp.  When the WARP executing remote commands, the malware creates a copy of the ?%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\cmd.exe? file as '%USERPROFILE%\\Temp\\~ISUN32.EXE'.  The version signature information of the duplicate executable is zeroed out.  Some WARP variants maintain persistence through the use of DLL search order hijacking.",

      "description": "(Fox-IT) The new WastedLocker ransomware appeared in May 2020 (a technical description is included below). The ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an abbreviation of the victim’s name and the string ‘wasted’. The abbreviation of the victim’s name was also seen in 'BitPaymer', although a larger portion of the organisation name was used in BitPaymer and individual letters were sometimes replaced by similar looking numbers.\n\nTechnically, WastedLocker does not have much in common with BitPaymer, apart from the fact that it appears that victim specific elements are added using a specific builder rather than at compile time, which is similar to BitPaymer. Some similarities were also noted in the ransom note generated by the two pieces of malware. The first WastedLocker example we found contained the victim name as in BitPaymer ransom notes and also included both a protonmail.com and tutanota.com email address. Later versions also contained other Protonmail and Tutanota email domains, as well as Eclipso and Airmail email addresses. Interestingly the user parts of the email addresses listed in the ransom messages are numeric (usually 5 digit numbers) which is similar to the 6 to 12 digit numbers seen used by BitPaymer in 2018.",

Each file provides a specific remote control feature and is downloaded from the attackers’ server every time the system starts up. These files are not saved on disk or in the registry but are loaded directly into the memory.\n\nAt the very start of the operation, after launching the driver, PlusDLL collects information about the infected system. A unique identifier for the infected computer is generated based on information about the hard drive and the network adapter’s MAC address, e.g., TKVFP-XZTTL-KXFWH-RBJLF-FXWJR. The attackers are interested primarily in the computer’s name, the program which loaded the malicious library, as well as information about remote desktop sessions (session name, client name, user name and session time). All of this data is collected in a buffer, which is then compressed and sent to the attackers’ control center.\n\nIn reply to this initial message from the bot, the control center sends the list of available plugins. Plugins are DLL libraries that provide specific remote control functions. Upon receiving the list of plugins, the bot downloads them, allocates them in the memory and passes control to these libraries.\n\nAlso see 'HighNoon', which seems to be a variant of Winnti.",

As soon as you press the SPIN button (in our case it is greyed out because we are actually dispensing cash), the ATM starts dispensing cash from the corresponding cassette. Down from the SPIN button there is information about the cassette (bank note value and the number of bank notes in the cassette). The SCAN button rescans the ATM and updates the numbers under the SLOT button, while the STOP button stops the dispensing in progress.",

It is notable because it uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to establish persistence. VBS_WIMMIE registers a script that works as a backdoor to the WMI event handler and deletes files associated with it or TROJ_WIMMIE. As a result, the backdoor cannot be detected by antivirus software through simple file scanning.The compromised computer posts data to a PHP script that runs on the C&C server, usually count.php.\n\nThe initial communication results in the creation of a file on the C&C server that contains information on the compromised computer. Although the file is empty, the file name contains the hostname of the compromised computer, followed by its MAC address, along with the campaign code the attackers use to identify which malware attack caused the compromise:\n~[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]\n\nThe attacker then creates a file with a name that ends in @.c, which contains a command.\n[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@.c\n\nThe compromised computer then downloads the file and executes the specified command, which may include any of the following:\n• Get external IP address\n• Execute shell command\n• Download file\n• Upload file\n\nThe compromised computer then sends the output to the C&C server and deletes the command file.",

We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active.\n\nWe identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Thailand. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without much disruption.",

When a file with an interesting extension (the same list as for XDList) is found, it encrypts it using RC4 (the hard-coded key is 1234123412341234) and uploads it to the C&C server.\nIt also takes a screenshot every minute. Unlike the screenshots taken by 'XDList', the image is not encrypted and is stored in %TEMP%\\tmp%YEAR%%MONTH%%DAY%_%TICK_COUNT%.s. The screenshot is uploaded to the C&C immediately after being taken.\nFinally, XDMonitor sends regular debug messages to the C&C server.",

What is surprising is that the paths are directly hard coded in the samples and not retrieved dynamically by a request to the C&C server.

OpenSSL 1.0.1p is statically linked to it, thus its size is roughly 1.2 MB. In subsequent months, that size increased up to 1.6 MB.\nIn January 2017, with version 1.14.8.0, OpenSSL 1.0.2j was linked to it, increasing the size to 1.8 MB. Soon after also in January 2017, with version v1.15.0.0 the code was obfuscated, blowing up the size of the binary to 2.2 MB.\n\nPlease note that IBM X-Force decided to call win.zloader/win.zeus_openssl 'Zeus Sphinx', after mentioning it as 'a new version of Zeus Sphinx' in their initial post in August 2016. Malpedia thus lists the alias 'Zeus XSphinx' for win.zeus_openssl - the X to refer to IBM X-Force.\n\nZeus Sphinx on the one hand has the following versioning ('slow increase')\n- 2015/09 v1.0.1.0 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n- 2016/02 v1.0.1.2 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n- 2016/04 v1.0.2.0 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n\nZeus OpenSSL on the other hand has the following versioning ('fast increase')\n- 2016/05 v1.5.4.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 1.2 MB)\n- 2017/01 v1.14.8.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 1.8 MB)\n- 2017/01 v1.15.0.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 2.2 MB)",

More recently, we have seen injects for online payment sites, casinos, retailers, and more appearing in banking Trojan campaigns.\n\nSince November -- a period of time that includes Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and now leading up to Christmas -- we have observed Zeus Panda banking Trojan campaigns that have an increasing focus on non-banking targets with an extensive list of injects clearly designed to capitalize on holiday shopping and activities.",

In that case it was targeting Symbian smartphones. Later on, ZitMo versions for Windows Mobile and Blackberry were found. It comes as no surprise that cybercriminals have created new and sophisticated pieces of mobile malware for Symbian and Windows Mobile; more surprising is that Blackberry devices were also targeted; and even more surprising is that until July 2011 there was no evidence of ZitMo for Android’s existence. And now please ‘welcome’ ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.\n\nThe first fact that must be mentioned is that ZitMo for Android differs from Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry versions a lot. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&C.\n\nThe functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive. The APK file itself has a 19k size. It passes itself off as a security tool from the ‘Trusteer’ company.",

It has some functions borrowed from 'Zeus' 2.0.8.9 (e.g. the versioning, nrv2b, binstorage-labels), but more importantly, it downloaded a Zeus-like banking trojan (-> Zeus OpenSSL). Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot. These changes may be related to the Moskalvzapoe Distribution Network, which started the distribution of it at the same time.",
